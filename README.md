  ## User Story
  AS A manager at an internet retail company
  I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
  SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites. Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site.

  ## Technologies
